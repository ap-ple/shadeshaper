Python 3.11 (or higher) and the `Pygame` library are required to run the game. Visit the [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Download Python") page to install Python, and use the command `pip install pygame` to install Pygame. Once installed, run `main.pyw` or `run_game.py` (there is also an `editor.py` where you can create levels). Use `A` and `D` to move left and right (respectively), `SPACE` to jump, and right click to place the light source. The goal is to reach the green platforms without touching the light.
